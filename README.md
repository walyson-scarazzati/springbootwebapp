# Run this project 
- Run the command ```mvn clean install```  in the project folder, or in Eclipse IDE, right-click on the project and select Run As > Maven Install to generate the .jar file.
- When I tried running the following command: ```docker build -t spring-boot-docker .``` I encountered the following error :

- This issue occurred because CentOS Linux 8 reached its End of Life (EOL) on December 31st, 2021. Consequently, it no longer receives updates or support from the official CentOS project.
For fix this:

- Another problem is that the build is successful, but the default Java version doesn't run the application. Java 11 is required because the application is built for that version:

- It is now okay to run the command to create image: ```docker build -t spring-boot-docker .``` 

- After this, run the following command to running container: ```docker run -d -p 8080:8080 spring-boot-docker.```

- Now we can test application: http://localhost:8080/
